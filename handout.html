    Project #3: <em>Indexing</em></h1>

<p>
In this project, you will write code
to generate an <em>index</em> for a text file.
</p>


<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>
By completing this project, you will:
</p>
<ul><li>
    become comfortable writing code that uses linked tree structures
    (in particular, self-balancing search trees);
</li><li>
    become comfortable working with a larger project
    that contains multiple header and source files;
</li><li>
    gain some experience running an empirical comparison
    of different data structures.
</li></ul>


<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
We want to generate an <em>index</em> for a text file:
a list of all the words that appear in the file along with
the page numbers where each word appears.
To make sure the index is not too large, we specify
a <em>minimum word length</em> for the index
(every word whose length is <em>strictly shorter</em> than this minimum
will be ignored).
The general algorithm to generate the index is then the following:
</p>
<pre>    iterate over the words in the file (and their page number), and
    for each one:
        if the word length is at least the minimum:
            add the current page number for this word
    
    print the list of words with their page numbers, sorted alphabetically
</pre>
<p>
We will provide a library that allows you to process a text file
word-by-word, and that also provides a page number for each word.
You have to implement <strong>two different ways</strong>
to maintain the list of words and their page numbers.
For one, you will use an AVL tree.
For the other, you will use a different kind of self-balancing tree
called <em>PSB trees</em>, for "<em>Pitt's Self-Balancing</em> trees"...  :)
</p>

<p>
A PSB tree is a BST where there is no explicit balancing information stored.
Instead, every time you search for a value and find it at a certain node,
you perform a <em>rotation operation</em> on that node and its parent.
The idea is that values that are accessed frequently automatically end up
closer to the root (where they can be found quickly), and
values that are accessed rarely automatically end up closer to the leaves.
(Note that PSB trees do <strong>not</strong> perform any rotations
during insertion or removal, only during searches and
only when the value we are searching for is found.)
</p>

<p>
Once you have implemented both kinds of self-balancing trees,
you will run experiments with various input text files,
to try and determine which one seems better.
(See below for the details of what we want you to do.)
</p>


<h2>What To Do</h2>

<h3>Part I: using AVL trees</h3>

<p>
First, download the starter code from Blackboard.
Read all of the code and, especially, the comments in these files.
</p>

<p>
Next, create a <code>Code::Blocks</code> project that contains
the files <code>index.c, avl_bag.c, bag.h, file_util.c, file_util.h</code>.
Add code to the main file "<code>index.c</code>"
(see the comments in the file for indications of what you need to do)
and test your project.
</p>

<p>
When you run the project with command line arguments
"<code>alice.txt 12</code>", it should generate the following output:
</p>
<pre>    Multiplication: 5
    Uglification: 40
    accidentally: 50
    affectionately: 36
    circumstances: 15
    consultation: 8
    contemptuous: 45
    contemptuously: 16, 28
    contradicted: 18
    conversation: 1, 7, 13, 16, 22, 27, 35, 37
    conversations: 1
    difficulties: 35
    disappointment: 1
    explanations: 44
    extraordinary: 21, 29
    frontispiece: 46
    hippopotamus: 6
    inquisitively: 6
    interrupting: 30, 53
    neighbouring: 54
    nevertheless: 12
    occasionally: 22
    refreshments: 46
    straightened: 34
    straightening: 23
    thoughtfully: 18, 28, 43, 44
    thunderstorm: 38
    triumphantly: 29, 53
    uncomfortable: 8, 12, 26, 35
    uncomfortably: 37
</pre>
<p>
Notice how each page number is preceded by a space, with commas
(<code>','</code>) between page numbers and a colon (<code>':'</code>)
between each word and the list of page numbers.
Make sure your code produces <strong>exactly this output format</strong>!
Any deviation from this (including any additional messages printed
by your code) will make our testing scripts fail!
</p>

<h3>Part II: implementing PSB trees</h3>

<p>
Once you get this working, create a second <code>Code::Blocks</code> project
with the files <code>index.c, bag.h, file_util.c, file_util.h</code>, and
a new source file "<code>psb_bag.c</code>".
This file will implement the types and functions from <code>bag.h</code>
using a "PSB tree" as described above.
<em>Think carefully about the design of your code.</em>
In particular, you should not need to make any changes to your code
in <code>index.c</code> at this point.
</p>

<h3>Part III: comparing the implementations</h3>

<p>
Finally, write a comparison of the AVL tree data structure and
the PSB tree data structure.
Start by comparing the efficiency of both data structures,
by running timing experiments for each one.
Then compare and discuss all other aspects of the two data structures:
ease of implementation, size of the code, <em>etc</em>.
</p>

<p>
Write a detailed report with all of your conclusions in a separate
text file named "<code>report.txt</code>".
Your report should be at least a few dozen lines long,
but no more than a few hundred lines long
(with 60–80 characters per line).
We want you to be reasonably thorough in your comparison,
but reasonably concise in the way you write it up!
</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>
You must submit the following files on <a href="https://stanley.cdf.toronto.edu/markus/csc190-2012-01">MarkUs</a>:
</p>
<ul><li>
    <code>index.c</code>
</li><li>
    <code>psb_bag.c</code>
</li><li>
    <code>report.txt</code>
</li></ul>

<h3>Important Notes</h3>

<p>
Make sure that all of your code is
well-structured, well-designed, well-documented, and well formatted.
(See the Style Guide for details.)
</p>

<p>
<strong><em>WARNING!</em>
    The file <code>report.txt</code> must be in plain text,
    <em>NOT</em> a Word document!</strong>
If you submit a Word document,
<em>MarkUs</em> will be unable to display it and
<strong>it will not be marked</strong>!
</p>

<p>
There are many aspects of your code that are not fully specified in this
handout. This is done on purpose, to allow you some freedom in the way you
design your code. <em>Please document all of your design decisions
carefully</em>. In other words, whenever you make a design decision,
please write a detailed comment to explain your decision (<em>what</em>
you've decided to do, and <em>why</em>).
</p>

<p>
<strong>You are expected to follow all of the design and style principles
you learned in CSC180!</strong>
For more information and guidelines specific to C, please consult the
documents posted on the Projects page of the course website (on Blackboard).
</p>

<h3>Partners</h3>

<p>
You are strongly encouraged to work in pairs on this project, but you are
not required to do so if you prefer to work alone— however, in this
case, you accept that you will receive <em>no</em> special consideration for
having worked on this Project alone.
</p>

<p>
Please follow the General Instructions posted on the Projects page on
Blackboard.  In addition, <strong>please include a comment on the very first
line of your submitted file with your ECF username (and that of your
partner, if applicable)</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Testing and Marking</h3>

<p>
Our marking will focus on your report (worth roughly 25% of your grade)
and the following five main aspects of your program (worth the remaining
75% of your grade):
</p>
<ul><li>
    <em>Design</em>: The algorithm implemented by your functions should be
    clear and simple, as should the way your code manages information.
    <strong>For this project, design will be the most important
    component of your program (<em>i.e.</em>, worth the most).</strong>
</li><li>
    <em>Correctness</em>: Your functions should perform according to their
    specifications (as described above and in the comments in the starter
    code).
    <strong>Note that correctness will NOT constitute the largest component of
    your mark.</strong>
</li><li>
    <em>Style</em>: Your variables should be meaningful, your code
    should be as clear and simple as possible, with good attempts to avoid
    duplicated code, and you should make good (and appropriate use) of the
    various features of C (<em>e.g.</em>, preprocessor constants).
</li><li>
    <em>Documentation</em>: Your functions should include "external"
    comments to describe what they do (already provided for the functions in
    the starter code, but you will have to supply them for any helper
    functions you add), and you should have internal comments that describe
    how your functions are implemented.
</li><li>
    <em>Formatting</em>: Your program should be formatted in a way that is
    readable, and adheres to the basic C style guidelines posted on the
    Projects page.
</li></ul>

<p>
Please read the "style guide" posted on the main Projects page on Blackboard
for more detailed information, and make sure to follow all of its
recommendations!
</p>

<h2>Hints and Tips</h2>

<ul><li>
    Write out how your algorithms will work in English first (or whatever
    language you prefer to speak), and use this as your internal function
    comments.  Once you've figured out how you'd do it without a computer,
    it'll be much easier to figure out how to write a solution in C.
</li><li>
    When working with linked data structures, <strong>draw lots of
    pictures</strong> to help you figure out what's going on!  Use the same
    style as in the lecture notes, with boxes for nodes and arrows for
    pointers, and if that's not precise enough to help you understand how to
    carry out a certain task, don't hesitate to draw a full memory
    model— after all, that's exactly what it's for.
</li><li>
    Remember to <strong>submit early and submit often</strong>!
    We strongly recommend that you submit <em>every time</em> that you
    complete one more function, or that you fix one more bug, or that you
    add any significant amount of code to your solution.  This guarantees
    that we have a record of all of your work leading up to the deadline,
    even in the event of last-minute submission problems.
